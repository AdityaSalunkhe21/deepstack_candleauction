# Candle Auction Smart Contract

This project contains a simple implementation of a Candle Auction smart contract in Solidity. The contract allows users to start an auction, place bids, and end the auction with a random end time. This README file provides instructions on how to test this smart contract using the Remix IDE.

Reason to choose Remix IDE is solely due to availability of unlimited Test Eth.
If you have enough Sepolia Testnet Eth, I have already deployed and verified the smart contract at [here](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x182422ef05F497140A128D3958633bd7fe9382D8)
Try running some of the following tasks:

##Instructions
###1. Open Remix IDE
Open your web browser and navigate to [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org).
Create a new file named CandleAuction.sol in the contracts directory and paste the code available in the repository
